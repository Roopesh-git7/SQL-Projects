# 🧪 Clinical Trial Dataset — SQL & Data Analysis Project

This project analyzes a clinical trial dataset to explore patient demographics, treatment groups, medical outcomes, dosage effects, and trial performance indicators.  
It demonstrates practical SQL and analytical skills including data cleaning, descriptive statistics, aggregations, table transformations, group-based comparisons, and medical outcome evaluation.  
This project is ideal for showcasing real-world healthcare analytics skills using SQL and data analysis techniques.

The dataset `clinictrial.csv` contains information about individual participants enrolled in a clinical trial, including age, gender, treatment type, dosage, outcome, and medical conditions.

## 🎯 Project Objective

The goal of this project is to:

- Explore and analyze clinical trial data using SQL and analytical queries  
- Evaluate treatment effectiveness across groups  
- Clean and preprocess clinical trial records  
- Build meaningful medical insights from trial outcomes  
- Demonstrate SQL-based healthcare data analytics  
- Create a complete, portfolio-ready project

## 🗂️ Dataset Description

The project uses the **clinical trial dataset** (`clinictrial.csv`), containing one record per trial participant.

### 📌 Columns Included:

| Column Name | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| patient_id | Unique identifier for each participant |
| age | Age of the patient |
| gender | Gender of the participant |
| treatment | Assigned treatment group (e.g., Drug A, Drug B, Placebo) |
| dosage | Amount of dosage administered (mg) |
| condition | Medical condition or category |
| response | Patient's improvement status or effectiveness indicator |
| visit_date | Date of follow-up or evaluation |
| notes | Additional clinical notes or qualitative observations |

*(Column names may vary depending on original dataset structure.)*

## 🧠 SQL Concepts Demonstrated

This project includes a wide variety of SQL operations commonly used in healthcare analytics:

### ✔ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
- Handling missing values  
- Standardizing treatment names  
- Removing duplicate patient records  

### ✔ Descriptive Statistics  
- Average patient age  
- Treatment group population counts  
- Dosage distribution  
- Gender distribution  

### ✔ Group-Based Analytics  
- Comparing treatment effectiveness  
- Dosage vs. response analysis  
- Condition-wise patient counts  

### ✔ Filtering & Segmentation  
- Selecting high-risk patient groups  
- Filtering specific treatment arms  
- Age-group segmentation (e.g., <30, 30–50, >50)  

### ✔ Date & Time Functions  
- Visit frequency  
- Tracking follow-up intervals  
- Identifying late or missed visits  

### ✔ Views & Table Enhancements  
- Creating views for anonymized patient data  
- Creating summary views (treatment effectiveness view)  

### ✔ Aggregations  
- AVG(), MIN(), MAX(), COUNT(), SUM()  
- Grouping by treatment, gender, condition  

### ✔ Case Expressions  
- Categorizing patients into age brackets  
- Labeling outcome as Positive / Neutral / Negative  
- Risk-level categorization  

### ✔ Subqueries  
- Identifying highest responding treatment  
- Finding median dosage ranges  
- Filtering patients based on group-level statistics
